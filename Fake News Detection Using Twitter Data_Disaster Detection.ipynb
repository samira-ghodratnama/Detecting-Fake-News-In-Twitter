    "# Detecting Fake News From Twitter\n",
    "Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.\n",
    "The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a Kaggle Comptetion in which the goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.\n",
    "Dataset includes 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. Dataset is originally from https://appen.com/open-source-datasets/\n",
    "\n",
    "We first start with a very simple model as a hand-on explained in the Kaggle."
